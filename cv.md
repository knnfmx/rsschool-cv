### About me 

I'm always loved to create complicated things with many details. I have graphic design skills and an understanding of digital aesthetics. I love the design, and of course, love programming. Persevering and multitasking, with analytical thinking and an engineering mindset, I have a critical reflection on my past self-coding mistakes and can self-taught from them. I like to educate myself, open to cutting-edge technologies and challenges. I can easily go through training under the supervision of an experienced mentor and show a quality result, write complex clean code and maintain it. Perfect team player with a versatile personality and a sense of humor.

### Main goals and objectives 

I want to start a career as a Front-end at a creative company to become a part of the development team and advance to Senior Full-stack with the opportunity to become a Team Lead in the future. Iâ€™m always evolving and adding new programming languages, frameworks, and tools to my tech stack. 

### Skills 

HTML5 / CSS (SCSS, SASS)/ Javascript (jQuery, Webpack) /  Bootstrap / Git / npm / CMS (Wordpress, Joomla, MODX) / OS (windows, macOS) / cmd / terminal


### Code examples

**Details:** 

> I will give you a string. You respond with "VALID" if the string meets the requirements or "INVALID" if it does not. Passwords must abide by the following requirements: 
> - More than 3 characters but less than 20.
> - Must contain only alphanumeric characters.
> - Must contain letters and numbers.

**My solution:**

``` 
function validPass(password){
  let reg = new RegExp('^(?=.{4,20}$)(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-zA-Z])([a-zA-Z0-9]+)$', 'gi')
  if (reg.test(password)) {
    return "VALID";
  } else {
    return "INVALID";
  }
}
```
